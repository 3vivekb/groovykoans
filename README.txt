WELCOME TO THE GROOVY KOANS PROJECT

The Groovy Koans project is a collection of small exercises in the form of unit tests, designed to get Java
developers up to speed on Groovy features and common idioms. It starts by teaching you basic Groovy building
blocks, and gradually builds your knowledge towards metaprogramming, slurpers, and all the goodness Groovy has
to offer.

GETTING STARTED
  1.  Make sure you have JDK 1.6+ installed ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html )
  2.  Download the Koans package and unzip ( http://groovykoans.org )
  3.  Remove the solutions from the Koans ( $ ./gradlew removeSolutions )
  4.  Execute Koan01... and fail ( $ ./gradlew koan01 [or any other koan using ./gradlew koan##] )
  5.  Fix code, and execute again
  6.  Keep going until you're fluent at Groovy :)

CREDITS
The Koan concept started way back in Zen practice. It was then adapted by the good folks of
rubykoans.com and perfected by Neo4j. Thanks to everyone!

MORE KOANS PLANNED...
  * Built-in builders (Xml, Html, Swing, Ant)
  * Own builder
  * SQL and Database Access
  * Testing
  * Embedding Groovy
